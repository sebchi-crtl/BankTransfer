# BankTransfer

This is the interview solution

* ## Bank List ##

url = core-banking/banks

request method = get

request body = null

* Note: I did get the data of the bank name because it wasn't placed in paystack api and muttple call back is not necessary, which can be done in client-side from a professional view


* ## Validate Account ##

url = core-banking/validateBankAccount

request method = post

request body = {
    "account_number": "",
    "account_bank": ""
  }

* Note: null *
